# Final Project Milestone II

*Place this document in your final project repo folder `/etc`. *

Come up with interfaces for 3 possible classes you think you may need for your project. Again, brainstorm a little. Nothing is *wrong*.

## Class Interface 1

class Player:
  def __init__ (self, name, major, age):
    self.name= name
    self.major= major
    self.age= age
    self.year= "freshman"
    self.classes= []
  

## Class Interface 2

< add your interface >

## Class Interface 3
